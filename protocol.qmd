## Downloading the data

To download the data, I used [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dharun4772/british-airline-review-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1).

After that, I unzipped the file "airline_review.csv" and placed it in the project's working directory obtained via `getwd()`.

## Loading, inspecting and cleaning the data

I loaded the required libraries:

```{r}
libs <- c("tidyverse")
sapply(libs, require, character.only = TRUE)

```

Loaded the file and filtered out useless columns:

```{r}
df <- read_csv("airline_review.csv") %>%
  select(!c("...1", "header", "author", "content"))
```
